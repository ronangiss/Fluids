            <h2>Mass Conservation</h2>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Under most circumstances, mass is neither created or destroyed. Mass can 
                be transferred into energy such as in nuclear reactions, but this possibility
                can be ignored for most problems in fluids. Let's imagine a box of
                arbitrary size and shape such as the tank pictured below. If 
                the amount of fluid in the box is to be constant the amount of fluid flowing
                in must be equal to the amount of fluid flowing out. Alternatively, if more
                fluid is flowing in than is flowing out, the amount of fluid in the tank
                will increase over time. This form of analysis considering our arbitrary box
                of fluid is called control volume analysis. It may feel fairly straightforward
                for mass conservation but control volume analysis is an important tool
                for fluid physics.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Looking to get a better feel for mass conservation? 
                Try sliding the vertical gates up and down in the animation below
                to change the flow rates in or out of the tank.</p>
            <div id="animation_container">

                Click and drag the gates below to observe the results.

            <h3>Integral Forms</h3>

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;As we go to transfer this idea of mass conservation to an equation, 
                it's easiest to start with an integral expression representing 
                macroscopic movements of fluid such as in the tank pictured above. 
                The simplest expression would be that the time derivative of mass in
                our control volume is equal to the difference between the mass flow in and out.</p>

            <div class="equation_line">
                <span class="equation_left_hidden">
                    Accumulation term. The rate at which mass is appearing or 
                    disappearing from the control volume.

                <span class="equation">

                    </span>

                    <span class="equation_right">

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Advancing one step forward we could rewrite each term as an integral
                for our control volume box with volume V and surface S.</p>

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Where \( \rho \) is the density of the fluid (which potentially varies
                in our control volume), \( \vec{v} \) is the fluid velocity, and  
                \( \hat{n} \) is the normal vector of the control surface (i.e.
                surface of control volume)&mdash;pointing outwards. Check for yourself that
                the dot product results in mass flow in being positive and mass flow out being negative.</p>

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;If we assume that the fluid is incompressible (i.e. the fluid density
                is constant in space and time), then the material derivative of density
                is zero. This results in the simple expression that for an incompressible
                fluid the divergence of the velocity field is zero.
